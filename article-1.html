    <article class="article-body">
        <p>Managing money doesn't have to be complicated. The 50/30/20 budget rule is one of the simplest and most effective ways to take control of your finances. Created by Senator Elizabeth Warren and her daughter, this straightforward approach helps you allocate your after-tax income into three clear categories.</p>

        <h2>What is the 50/30/20 Rule?</h2>
        <p>The concept is simple: divide your take-home pay into three buckets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50% for Needs:</strong> Essential expenses you must pay, like rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, and minimum debt payments.</li>
            <li><strong>30% for Wants:</strong> Non-essential spending that makes life enjoyable, such as dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and vacations.</li>
            <li><strong>20% for Savings:</strong> Money set aside for the future, including emergency funds, retirement contributions, and extra debt payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Apply the Rule</h2>
        <p>Start by calculating your monthly after-tax income. If you earn $4,000 per month after taxes, your budget would look like this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Needs: $2,000 (50%)</li>
            <li>Wants: $1,200 (30%)</li>
            <li>Savings: $800 (20%)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <p>Track your spending for a month to see where your money actually goes. You might be surprised to find that some "needs" are actually "wants." Be honest with yourself about the difference.</p>
        <p>If your needs exceed 50%, look for ways to reduce fixed costs. Consider refinancing loans, switching to cheaper insurance, or finding a more affordable living situation.</p>
        <p>Automate your savings by setting up automatic transfers to your savings account on payday. This ensures you save before you have a chance to spend.</p>

        <h2>When to Adjust the Rule</h2>
        <p>The 50/30/20 rule is a guideline, not a strict law. If you live in a high-cost area, you might need to allocate more to needs. If you're aggressively paying off debt, you might shift more to savings.</p>
        <p>The key is to find a balance that works for your situation while still prioritizing both current happiness and future security.</p>
