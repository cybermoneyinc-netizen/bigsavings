        <p>An emergency fund is your financial safety net—money set aside for unexpected expenses like medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. Without one, a single emergency can lead to debt and financial stress. Here's how to build yours from scratch.</p>

        <h2>Why You Need an Emergency Fund</h2>
        <p>Life is unpredictable. According to studies, nearly 40% of Americans couldn't cover a $400 emergency expense without borrowing money or selling something. An emergency fund gives you peace of mind and prevents small setbacks from becoming major financial crises.</p>

        <h2>How Much Should You Save?</h2>
        <p>The general recommendation is 3-6 months of essential expenses. However, if you're just starting, aim for a smaller goal first:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Starter goal:</strong> $1,000 for immediate emergencies</li>
            <li><strong>Basic fund:</strong> 1 month of expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Solid fund:</strong> 3 months of expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Robust fund:</strong> 6+ months of expenses</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Expenses</h2>
        <p>Add up your essential monthly costs: rent/mortgage, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, and minimum debt payments. This is your baseline for calculating your goal.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Open a Separate Savings Account</h2>
        <p>Keep your emergency fund separate from your regular checking account. A high-yield savings account is ideal—it earns interest while keeping your money accessible.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Start Small</h2>
        <p>Don't be discouraged if you can only save $25 or $50 per month. The important thing is to start. Even small amounts add up over time. Set up automatic transfers on payday to make saving effortless.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Find Extra Money</h2>
        <p>Look for ways to boost your savings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Put tax refunds directly into savings</li>
            <li>Save any bonuses or unexpected income</li>
            <li>Sell items you no longer need</li>
            <li>Cut one subscription and save that amount</li>
            <li>Do a no-spend challenge for a week or month</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 5: Protect Your Fund</h2>
        <p>Only use your emergency fund for true emergencies—not sales, vacations, or regular expenses. Define what constitutes an emergency before you need to decide in the moment.</p>

        <h2>Building the Habit</h2>
        <p>Celebrate milestones along the way. Each $500 or $1,000 saved is an achievement worth acknowledging. Building an emergency fund is a marathon, not a sprint, but the financial security it provides is invaluable.</p>
