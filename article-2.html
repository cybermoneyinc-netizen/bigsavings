        <p>Groceries are one of the biggest household expenses, but they're also one of the most flexible. With some smart strategies, you can dramatically reduce your food spending without sacrificing nutrition or taste.</p>

        <h2>1. Make a Meal Plan</h2>
        <p>Planning your meals for the week before shopping prevents impulse purchases and ensures you only buy what you need. It also reduces food waste, which saves even more money.</p>

        <h2>2. Never Shop Hungry</h2>
        <p>Shopping on an empty stomach leads to impulse buys and larger purchases. Eat a snack before heading to the store to make more rational decisions.</p>

        <h2>3. Use a Shopping List</h2>
        <p>Write down exactly what you need and stick to it. Apps like AnyList or simple notes can help you stay organized and resist temptation.</p>

        <h2>4. Buy Store Brands</h2>
        <p>Generic or store-brand products are often made by the same manufacturers as name brands but cost 20-40% less. Try switching for staples like flour, sugar, canned goods, and cleaning supplies.</p>

        <h2>5. Shop Seasonally</h2>
        <p>Fruits and vegetables are cheapest when they're in season. Learn what's in season in your area and plan meals around those ingredients.</p>

        <h2>6. Use Coupons Strategically</h2>
        <p>Don't clip coupons for items you wouldn't normally buy. Focus on products you regularly use, and stack manufacturer coupons with store sales for maximum savings.</p>

        <h2>7. Buy in Bulk Wisely</h2>
        <p>Bulk buying saves money on non-perishables and items you use frequently, but only if you'll actually use them before they expire. Calculate the unit price to ensure you're getting a deal.</p>

        <h2>8. Reduce Meat Consumption</h2>
        <p>Meat is often the most expensive item in a grocery cart. Try incorporating more plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and eggs, which are nutritious and budget-friendly.</p>

        <h2>9. Shop at Multiple Stores</h2>
        <p>Different stores have different strengths. Buy produce at farmers' markets, pantry staples at discount stores, and only specialty items at premium grocers.</p>

        <h2>10. Use Cashback Apps</h2>
        <p>Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Checkout 51 give you money back on purchases you're already making. It takes minimal effort and adds up over time.</p>
