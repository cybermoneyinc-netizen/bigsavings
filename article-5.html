        <p>Energy costs keep rising, but there are plenty of simple ways to fight back. These tips require little to no upfront investment and can start saving you money immediately.</p>

        <h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Adjust Your Thermostat:</strong> Lower your thermostat by 1-2 degrees in winter and raise it in summer. You won't notice the difference, but your bill will show it.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Use a Programmable Thermostat:</strong> Set it to reduce heating/cooling when you're asleep or away. Smart thermostats can save up to 15% on heating and cooling costs.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Seal Air Leaks:</strong> Check windows and doors for drafts. Weatherstripping and caulk are inexpensive fixes that make a big difference.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Use Ceiling Fans Wisely:</strong> Run fans counterclockwise in summer to create a cooling breeze. In winter, reverse them to push warm air down.</p>

        <h2>Lighting</h2>
        <p><strong>5. Switch to LED Bulbs:</strong> LEDs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs and last 25 times longer. They pay for themselves quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Use Natural Light:</strong> Open curtains during the day instead of turning on lights. Position desks and seating areas near windows.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Turn Off Lights:</strong> Make it a habit to turn off lights when leaving a room. Consider motion-sensor switches for forgetful family members.</p>

        <h2>Appliances</h2>
        <p><strong>8. Unplug Devices:</strong> Electronics draw power even when turned off (phantom load). Unplug chargers, TVs, and other devices when not in use, or use smart power strips.</p>
        <p><strong>9. Run Full Loads:</strong> Only run your dishwasher and washing machine with full loads. This maximizes efficiency per cycle.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Air Dry When Possible:</strong> Skip the heated dry cycle on your dishwasher. Hang clothes to dry instead of using the dryer.</p>
        <p><strong>11. Clean Your Refrigerator Coils:</strong> Dusty coils make your fridge work harder. Clean them every six months for optimal efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Water Heating</h2>
        <p><strong>12. Lower Water Heater Temperature:</strong> Set it to 120°F instead of the default 140°F. You'll save energy without sacrificing comfort.</p>
        <p><strong>13. Take Shorter Showers:</strong> Cutting your shower by just 2 minutes can save significant water and energy costs over a year.</p>
        <p><strong>14. Fix Leaky Faucets:</strong> A dripping hot water faucet wastes both water and energy. Fix leaks promptly.</p>

        <h2>General Tips</h2>
        <p><strong>15. Get an Energy Audit:</strong> Many utility companies offer free home energy audits. They'll identify the biggest opportunities for savings in your specific home.</p>

        <h2>Track Your Progress</h2>
        <p>Compare your bills month-over-month and year-over-year to see the impact of your changes. Many utility companies offer online tools to track usage patterns and identify opportunities for additional savings.</p>
